# ggplot-exploration

This repository is intended to host some detailed exploration (and a useful index of) ggplot basics and more complicated features.  It is loosely based around the Hadley Wickham book [_ggplot2_](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) - with some of the code examples directly incorporated here.

## ggplot2 geoms

__geoms.R__, shows examples for each of the individual geoms avaiable in standard ggplot2.
